      "Every day people fund the brands they love: coffee in the morning, shoes for the season, a new phone every few years. That spending builds companies, but the customer keeps nothing except a receipt.",
      "STOCKBACK starts from a simple idea: a verified purchase can become a small, real stake in what you buy.",
    ],
  },
  {
    t: "The problem",
    b: [
      "Loyalty points are closed-loop, lose value and quietly expire. Crypto cashback usually pays in tokens unrelated to what you bought, and rarely proves the purchase happened, or happened only once.",
    ],
  },
  {
    t: "The protocol",
    b: [
      "Evidence stays off-chain. An attester signs a claim that contains only hashes. On-chain, one transaction checks the signature, burns a nullifier so the receipt can never count twice, applies eligibility and reward rules, and deposits shares into the brand's vault in your name.",
    ],
  },
  {
    t: "Why proof matters",
    b: [
      "Rewards without proof invite fraud; proof without limits invites abuse. STOCKBACK separates the two. Attestations prove the purchase, while caps and budgets bound what any wallet or brand can earn. We are explicit about the limits: a nullifier stops replay, not someone with many wallets.",
    ],
  },
  {
    t: "Why Stylus",
    b: [
      "Many services sign with Ed25519, which the EVM cannot verify natively. STOCKBACK verifies those signatures in Rust on Arbitrum Stylus. Measured on Robinhood Chain testnet, that costs 5 to 9 times less gas than the best Solidity implementation available, and 100 signatures fit in one transaction.",
    ],
  },
  {
    t: "Why tokenized ownership",
    b: [
      "A vault share is portable, composable and yours: no issuer can expire it or claw it back. On testnet the brand assets are simulated. In production, distributing exposure to tokenized equities would require issuer authorization and legal review, and the protocol is built so that compliance plugs in as an adapter.",
    ],
  },
  {
    t: "The long-term vision",
    b: [
      "A world where ownership follows participation: where the people who build a brand's revenue also share in its future, verified and without middlemen.",
