A 2:30 film with a real claim settled on Robinhood Chain testnet ([tx `0x1fc40e3e…7afa97`](https://explorer.testnet.chain.robinhood.com/tx/0x1fc40e3e608da143515f62a81830072265914606311f56ec34ca7adfee7afa97)). Every frame, the score and the mix were made in code ([film/](film/README.md)).

## Introduction

Every purchase leaves evidence behind: a receipt, a UPI reference, an order email. Reward programs turn that evidence into points that expire, get devalued, and sit in one of the 15 programs you joined and forgot.

**STOCKBACK** changes two things:

1. **The trust origin.** The merchant's till signs every receipt field with Ed25519. STOCKBACK verifies that signature, not a photo, and checks it on-chain in Rust on **Arbitrum Stylus**.
2. **The reward.** A verified purchase becomes **shares of that brand's ERC-4626 vault**, held in your wallet. The vault has no admin, no pause and no sweep, so no one can dilute, freeze or expire your shares.

One transaction does it all: the registry verifies the claim, burns a per-receipt nullifier, applies eligibility, caps and a sponsor budget, then deposits into the vault in your name.

**Global protocol, rail-first launch.** Nothing in STOCKBACK is tied to one country:
- Every brand sets its own currency (an ISO-4217 code on-chain, so INR, SGD and USD all work) and its own amount bounds.
- Geography goes through a pluggable `IJurisdictionPolicy` adapter instead of hardcoded rules.
- Sponsors fund rewards in USDG, a dollar stablecoin.

We launch where every payment already carries a digital merchant trail, which is exactly where merchant-signed receipts plug in:
- **Singapore**, through PayNow and SGQR
- **India**, through UPI

The live demo is priced in INR for that reason.

## The problem

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/problem-forgery.jpg" alt="A receipt photo proves nothing" width="100%"></p>

**A receipt photo is no longer evidence.**
- In a 2026 paired study, people picked an AI-edited receipt over its authentic twin **50.1%** of the time, which is chance.
- The best forensic detectors reached an AUC of only **0.53–0.60** ([Wu et al., arXiv:2604.25213](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.25213)).
- Digital document forgeries rose **244%** year on year (Entrust 2025, cited there).

Any reward, refund or warranty flow that trusts pixels is paying out on fakes.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/problem-points.jpg" alt="Points never feel like yours" width="100%"></p>

**Points never feel like yours.**
- People belong to **14.8** loyalty programs and use **6.7**.
- **73%** find loyalty programs too complicated.
- About **60%** of coalition programs fail within ten years.

Operators can also expire or devalue balances at will (Bond Loyalty Report 2020, via [arXiv:2512.00738](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00738)).

## The painkiller

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/solution.jpg" alt="Seal the receipt. Own the brand." width="100%"></p>

| | Step | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 読 | **Scan** | The merchant's till signs the receipt. You scan its QR. No photo needs to be trusted. |
| 証 | **Prove** | The signature is checked, the receipt counts once, and Stylus verifies the claim on-chain. |
| 有 | **Own** | You receive shares of that brand's vault. No admin can dilute, freeze or expire them. |

## What makes it different

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/uniqueness.jpg" alt="Four guarantees. One transaction." width="100%"></p>

| Guarantee | How | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Signature, not pixels** | The till signs 8 fields (merchant, brand, receipt ID, amount, currency, issue, expiry). Change one digit and the claim fails. | `web/lib/merchant-pos.mjs`, `web/app/api/attest` |
| **Counted once, for anyone** | `nullifier = keccak256(tag, merchantId, receiptHash)`, independent of claimant, amount and deadline, burned on-chain | `src/PurchaseClaim.sol`, `ReceiptCommitmentRegistry` |
| **Yours, no admin** | One ERC-4626 vault per brand, with no owner, pause or sweep. `_decimalsOffset = 6` blocks inflation attacks. | `src/BrandVault.sol` |
| **9.2x cheaper to verify** | Strict Ed25519 in Rust on Stylus, behind the same `verify(bytes32,bytes)` ABI as the Solidity verifier | `stylus/receipt-prover` |

**The vault is not the moat. The moat is the verification and eligibility pipeline** that connects an off-chain purchase to an on-chain ownership allocation, with every key's authority bounded.

| Layer | Component | Responsibility |

| Eligibility | `RewardPolicy` | `reward = amount × rate × multiplier`; per-claim, daily-user and daily-brand caps (caps reject, they don't clip) |
| Ownership | `RewardPool` | Sponsor-funded budget per brand; pays only what was deposited |
| Ownership | `BrandVaultFactory`, `BrandVault` | One admin-less ERC-4626 vault per brand (CREATE2, salt = brandId) |
| Funding | `USDGRewardAdapter` | Optional: fund the budget in USDG, swapped to the brand asset with oracle-bounded slippage (SwapRouter02) |

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/trust-boundary.jpg" alt="Who holds which key" width="100%"></p>

**Trust boundary:**
- The till holds the merchant private key.
- The attester holds only the merchant **public** key plus its own key.
- The chain holds no secrets.
- No key ever reaches the browser; `npm run check:secrets` verifies the client bundle.

## Workflows

### 1. From receipt to ownership

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/how-it-works.jpg" alt="From receipt to ownership in six steps" width="100%"></p>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant M as Merchant POS (simulated)
    participant U as Shopper + wallet
    participant A as Attester API
    participant R as Registry (Robinhood Chain)
    participant S as Stylus verifier
    participant V as Brand vault
    M->>U: Signed receipt QR (Ed25519 over 8 fields)
    U->>A: Raw payload (QR)
    A->>A: Verify merchant sig, expiry, brand
    A->>R: previewClaim (nullifier unused?)
    A-->>U: EIP-712 claim (hashes only) + attestation
    U->>R: submitClaim(claim, attestation)
    R->>S: verify(digest, attestation)
    S-->>R: true
    R->>R: Burn nullifier, eligibility, caps, budget
    R->>V: Deposit reward for shopper
    V-->>U: Vault shares (sbNKE)
```

### 2. Inside the one claim transaction

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/one-transaction.jpg" alt="Inside one claim transaction" width="100%"></p>

Every check runs on-chain, in order. If any fails, nothing changes and the receipt is not burned. `previewClaim` returns exactly the status `submitClaim` would revert with, so the UI explains a rejection before the wallet opens.

### 3. The live demo, step by step

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/workflow.jpg" alt="The workflow, live" width="100%"></p>

1. Open **[/merchant](https://stockbacks.vercel.app/merchant)**, pick a brand and amount, then **Issue signed receipt**.
2. Scan the QR with a phone, or press **Claim in STOCKBACK**.
3. Connect a wallet on Robinhood Chain testnet, then **Verify signature**: merchant signature ✓, attested ✓, new receipt ✓, eligible ✓.
4. **Claim ownership**. One transaction, verified by Stylus. **View transaction** shows it on the explorer.
5. Open the same QR again: *"This receipt has already been claimed."* Edit any field in the link: *"The merchant signature doesn't match."*

## Evidence tiers

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/evidence-tiers.jpg" alt="Not every proof proves the same thing" width="100%"></p>

The on-chain path is identical for every claim. What differs is what the attester checked before signing, and the app labels it on every screen.

| Tier | Evidence | Establishes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Merchant-signed receipt** | The receipt is unaltered since the merchant key signed it. Merchant simulated in the demo. | Live demo |
| 2 | **Attested photo / OCR** | Only that the attester signed what it was given; authenticity is **not** established | Live demo |
| 3 | **Verified payment / order evidence** (zkTLS) | Provenance from the payment or order source itself | Roadmap |

## Stylus benchmark

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/benchmark.jpg" alt="9.2x less gas with Stylus" width="100%"></p>

Strict Ed25519 verification of attestation signatures, measured on **Robinhood Chain testnet** with `eth_estimateGas` and byte-identical calldata:

| Batch | Solidity Ed25519 | Stylus Ed25519 | Solidity ÷ Stylus |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 736,502 gas | 140,063 gas | 5.3× |
| 10 | 6,214,368 gas | 724,659 gas | 8.6× |
| 50 | 30,555,405 gas | 3,327,511 gas | 9.2× |
| 100 | exceeds the 32M per-tx cap | 6,583,441 gas | n/a |

- **Marginal cost:** about 608k gas per signature in Solidity against about 65k in Stylus.
- **Capacity:** 100 signatures fit in one transaction with Stylus; Solidity can't fit 53.
- **ECDSA** through the EVM precompile is cheaper still, so Stylus earns its place for schemes the EVM lacks.

Methodology: **[benchmarks/results/BENCHMARKS.md](benchmarks/results/BENCHMARKS.md)**. The fitted gas model is in the **[whitepaper](whitepaper/STOCKBACK-Whitepaper.pdf)**.

## Market gap

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/readme/market.jpg" alt="The rails already exist" width="100%"></p>

| What exists | What's missing | STOCKBACK |
|---|---|---|
| **Receipt-scanning cashback apps** reward a photo | A photo proves nothing now: humans spot fakes at chance, detectors barely do better | Trust moves to a merchant signature, labelled by evidence tier |
| **Loyalty points** (closed or coalition) | Points expire, get devalued, and are locked to one program; coalitions take a 10–30% cut and hold brand data | Admin-less ERC-4626 vault shares per brand, with no operator in the middle |
| **Crypto cashback** pays unrelated tokens | No proof the purchase happened, or happened once | One nullifier per receipt, enforced on-chain |
| **zkTLS / web proofs** (DECO, TLSNotary) | Not yet wired into rewards | A tier-3 slot already designed into the evidence model |

The rails already exist: India alone processed **24.07 billion UPI payments in September 2026** (NPCI), and Singapore's PayNow and SGQR carry the same kind of merchant trail. The loyalty-management market is **$15.3B in 2026**, projected to reach **$31.1B by 2033** (Grand View Research). These are third-party figures for context; STOCKBACK has no users or revenue yet.

Deeper analysis with citations: **[docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md)**.

## Security, privacy and limits

- **Anti-replay:** `nullifier = keccak(tag, merchantId, receiptHash)`. The same receipt cannot be claimed twice, even with a different claimant, amount, brand or deadline.
- **Anti-front-running:** the claimant is signed and must be `msg.sender`.
- **Domain separation:** EIP-712 over the chain ID and registry address. Cross-chain and cross-deployment replays are tested.
- **Merchant signatures (tier 1):** every field is signed. Tampering, a wrong key, expiry, unsupported brands and already-used receipts are rejected before the attester signs. The demo POS is public, so this shows the mechanism, not fraud resistance.
- **Bounded authority:** the verifier only returns a bool, only the registry spends budget, and vault assets are unreachable by any admin. An attester-key leak is bounded by the per-brand daily cap (100,000 demo units) and the budget. The key can be rotated on the Stylus allowlist without a redeploy.
- **Sybil resistance (partial):** nullifiers stop receipt replay, **not** multi-wallet farming. Rewards attach to receipts, not identities.
- **Privacy:** raw receipts, UPI IDs, names and phones never go on-chain, and receipt hashes are salted. Amount, merchant hash and time are public ([docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md)).
- **Not built yet:** a hold period with refund voiding. Rewards settle instantly.

The full checklist maps every risk to the test that covers it: **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

**Tests:**
- 83 Foundry tests: unit, integration, 3 fuzz tests at 1,000 runs and 5 invariants
- 5 Rust tests over 100 shared vectors
- 20 receipt-signing unit tests
- 22 live-testnet integration checks
- an 11-step browser suite
- a secret-leak scan

All brand assets and USDG here are **mocks**. Full list: [`deployments/46630.json`](deployments/46630.json).

## FAQ

**Is STOCKBACK India-only?** No.
- Currency is set per brand, jurisdiction is an adapter, and rewards are funded in USDG.
- The demo uses INR because we launch on payment rails that already carry a merchant trail: Singapore (PayNow/SGQR) first, then India (UPI).
- Launching a brand in SGD or USD is one `setBrandRules` call, not a redeploy.

**Is the merchant real?** No. The point-of-sale in the demo is simulated, and its key is a demo key. In production the key lives inside the merchant's POS or HSM.

**Are the brand shares securities?** No. Every brand asset on testnet is a labelled mock. Issuer-authorized assets would sit behind the jurisdiction adapter ([docs/COMPLIANCE.md](docs/COMPLIANCE.md)).

**What if someone copies a receipt QR?** It's a bearer token, like a paper receipt: the first wallet to claim it wins, and every later attempt is rejected on-chain. Copying an *attestation* is useless, because the claimant is signed and must equal `msg.sender`.

script/demo.sh
```

**Web app:**

```bash
cd web && cp .env.example .env.local && npm install
npm run dev                                      # http://localhost:3000
npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint
npm run test:e2e                                 # live-testnet integration checks
```

See **[web/README.md](web/README.md)** for env vars and the merchant-receipt flow.

### Deploy to Robinhood Chain testnet

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # fill DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY, ATTESTER_ADDRESS (faucet: https://faucet.testnet.chain.robinhood.com/)
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
forge script script/DeployStockback.s.sol --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --broadcast --slow
# optional: Stylus verifier as the active verifier
# note: --constructor-args is variadic, keep it last
(cd stylus/receipt-prover && cargo stylus deploy -e "$RPC_URL" --private-key "$DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY" --no-verify --constructor-args <owner>)
```

The demo deploy script refuses any chain other than 31337, 46630 and 421614, and writes all addresses to `deployments/<chainId>.json`.

## Roadmap

| | Item |
|---|---|
| **Implemented** | Merchant-signed receipts (simulated merchant), photo/OCR attestation, per-receipt nullifier, caps and budgets, Stylus Ed25519 verification, admin-less vaults, USDG funding adapter |
| **Next** | A pending period with void-on-refund (needs new contracts; rewards currently settle instantly); real merchant keys inside a POS or HSM, plus a merchant key registry and revocation; attester rotation runbook and k-of-n attesters; stronger Sybil resistance; multisig and timelock on configuration; gasless claim relaying |
| **Later** | Tier 3: payment/order-source proofs (zkTLS); amount privacy; batch claims; issuer-authorized assets behind the jurisdiction adapter |

**Not claimed:** merchant partnerships, users, traction, or measured fraud reduction or retention effects. None exist yet.

The mapping to the judging criteria (contract quality, product-market fit, innovation, real problem solving, USDG, Robinhood Chain) is in **[docs/HACKATHON.md](docs/HACKATHON.md)**.

- **Adapted from Wield:**
  - Foundry setup and CI
  - the oracle freshness and slippage checks and chain-id guards (now in `USDGRewardAdapter` and the deploy script)
  - `IAggregatorV3`, `ISwapRouter` (corrected to SwapRouter02), and `MockUSDG` / `MockAggregatorV3`
- **Original STOCKBACK work:** the claim model, registry, verifiers (Solidity and Stylus), policies, reward pool, brand vault and factory, attester, merchant receipts, web app, benchmark, whitepaper, brand and film.
- **Not included:** Wield's vault, basket and P2P contracts; see [docs/MIGRATION_AUDIT.md](docs/MIGRATION_AUDIT.md).
- **Vendored:** the benchmark baseline uses [chengwenxi/Ed25519](https://github.com/chengwenxi/Ed25519) (Apache-2.0) under `benchmarks/solidity/src/vendor/`.
